# Ender 3 Neo Klipper Configuration

These are my configuration files for the Klipper install on my Ender 3 Neo. The host is a Raspberry Pi 4B and the printer is stock. Klipper was installed via [KIAUH](https://github.com/th33xitus/kiauh).

Please consider this to be a work in progress. I am constantly tinkering, improving, and breaking things. Remember, this is my configuration and it may not work as intended on your machine. Review the files before deploying as I am not responsible for damage to your hardware.
